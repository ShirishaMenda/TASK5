Containerizing a Strapi Application

STEP 1:
Prepare your Strapi project.

Make sure your Strapi application is created and working on your machine.


STEP 2:
Build your Strapi project.
Generate the production build so Strapi can run properly inside Docker.

STEP 3:
Create a .dockerignore file.
Add the files and folders that should not be included in the Docker image.

STEP 4:
Create a Dockerfile.
Write the instructions that tell Docker how to install, build, and run your Strapi app.

STEP 5:
Build the Docker image.
Ask Docker to create an image based on the Dockerfile you wrote.

STEP 6:
Run the Docker container.
Start the container from the image so Strapi runs locally on your computer.
